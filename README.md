## How It Works

1. User uploads a PDF file.
2. User inputs a question about the PDF.
3. The backend:
   - Extracts text and chunks from the PDF.
   - Embeds the content using Google Generative AI embedding models.
   - Uses a RAG pipeline to generate a relevant response.
4. The response and supporting context documents are shown.
5. Rouge scores are computed between the response and context as a quality metric.
