<pre lang="md"> ```md # Chatpdf! **Chatpdf** is a Streamlit-based web app that allows users to upload a PDF document, ask questions about its content, and receive instant, context-aware answers powered by a Google Generative AI model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). **🚀 Live App:** 👉 [Click to Open Chatpdf](https://rohitashbishnoi91-chatpdf-using-rag-app-j0q8fy.streamlit.app/) --- ## 🔍 Features - 📄 Upload any PDF file for instant question answering - 💬 Ask natural language questions about the PDF content - 🤖 Powered by Google Gemini (Generative AI) models - 📈 View ROUGE scores for generated answers to evaluate quality - 🧾 Clean, intuitive UI with Streamlit - 🗑️ Temporary file storage with automatic cleanup --- ## ⚙️ How It Works 1. Upload a PDF file via the UI 2. Enter a question related to the document 3. Backend processing includes: - Text extraction and chunking - Embedding with Google Generative AI - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce the answer 4. Generated response and supporting context are shown 5. ROUGE scores computed for evaluation --- ## 🧪 Installation > Requires Python 3.8+ ```bash git clone https://github.com/aartiksaini/pdf_reading_using_RAG.git cd pdf_reading_using_RAG python -m venv .venv # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate # On macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate pip install -r requirements.txt ``` --- ## 🔑 Setup Google Generative AI API 1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) 2. Create or locate your API Key 3. Enable **Generative Language API** 4. Make sure there are no restrictions on the key 5. Set your API key in the code (in `helper.py`): ```python GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY" ``` --- ## ▶️ Usage ```bash streamlit run app.py ``` - Upload your PDF - Ask a question - View the answer + ROUGE score --- ## 🧯 Troubleshooting - **API key issues**: - Verify the key and model name are valid - Ensure the API is enabled in your Google Console - **Model not found**: - Use ListModels API to check available models - Update model name in code if needed --- ## 🗂️ Project Structure ``` . ├── app.py # Streamlit UI ├── helper.py # PDF parsing & API logic ├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies ├── README.md # Project documentation └── temp_uploaded.pdf # Temporary uploaded PDF (runtime only) ``` --- ## 📦 Dependencies - Streamlit - evaluate (for ROUGE scoring) - requests - langchain - PyPDF2 or pdfplumber - Other dependencies in `requirements.txt` --- ## 🚧 Future Improvements - Add caching to speed up repeated queries - Support more file types (e.g. DOCX) - Enhance error handling and UI feedback - Add user authentication for API usage tracking --- ## 👤 Author **Aartik Saini** ``` </pre>
